Zoo Project

The goal was to create a zoo program where animals have specific characteristics and behaviors.
Each animal should be able to:

Eat (common behavior for all animals).
Walk (for land animals).
Swim (for aquatic animals).
Be selected from a menu where the user can interact with them.
To achieve this, we used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like:  Inheritance – To extend the Animal class for different animals.
 Interfaces – To define behaviors like Eat, Walk, and Swim.
 Encapsulation – Using private and protected properties with getters and setters.
